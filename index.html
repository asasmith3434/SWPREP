     <img src="thumbnail_processed.jpg" class="person_image"> 
      <p> Using the image as a reference, the project will have a header "Star Wars Planets" with three buttons below it.
        One of the buttons being a list of all 10 of the first star wars planets on the API with their names being displayed. Futhermore,
        a list of information will be displayed; rotation_period, orbital_period, climate, terrain, and population. The second button 
        will be an if statement where all of the planets with a habitatal environment or population will be catorigized into it, and with
        the same information displayed for each planet. Lastly, the third button will display all of the planets which are not habital. 
        An if statement will be used and order all the planets which do not have a number for population, and there will be the same 
        information displayed along with the list of names.
